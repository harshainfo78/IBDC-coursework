**A brief history of Linux**

Linux is an operating system that evolved from a kernel created by Linus Torvalds when he was a student at the University of Helsinki in 1991. When Linus Torvalds was studying at the University of Helsinki, he was using a version of the UNIX operating system called 'Minix'. Linus and other users sent requests for modifications and improvements to Minix's creator, Andrew Tanenbaum, but he felt that they weren't necessary. That's when Linus decided to create his own operating system that would take into account users' comments and suggestions for improvements. 

**Introduction**

Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. The Linux Kernel is like the brain of the operating system because it manages how the computer interacts with its hardware and resources. But the Linux Kernel alone is not enough to make a complete operating system. To create a full and functional system, the Linux Kernel is combined with a collection of software packages and utilities, which are together called Linux distributions. These distributions make the Linux Operating System ready for users to run their applications and perform tasks on their computers securely and effectively. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and many others.
