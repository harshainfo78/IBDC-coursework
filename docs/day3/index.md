4. Hardware Layer: The hardware layer consists of physical components that execute commands and provide system resources. It includes RAM (Random Access Memory), HDD (Hard Disk Drive), CPU (Central Processing Unit), and input/output devices. This layer is responsible for interacting with the OS and providing the necessary resources for the system and applications to function properly. The Linux kernel and system libraries enable communication and control over these hardware components, ensuring that they work harmoniously together.

5. System Utility: System utilities are essential tools and programs provided by the Operating System to manage and configure various aspects of the system. These utilities perform tasks such as installing software, configuring network settings, monitoring system performance, managing users and permissions, and much more. System utilities simplify system administration tasks, making it easier for users to maintain their Linux systems efficiently.

## **The Terminal**

The terms “terminal,” “shell,” and “command line interface” are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them.

* A shell is a program that exposes the computer’s operating system to a user or program. In Linux systems, the shell presented in a terminal is a command line interpreter.
* A terminal is an input and output environment that presents a text-only window running a shell.
* A command line interface is a user interface (managed by a command line interpreter program) which processes commands to a computer program and outputs the results.

When it refers to one of these three terms in the context of Linux, it generally means a terminal environment where users can run commands and see the results printed out to the terminal.
